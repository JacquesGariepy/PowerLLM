# PowerLLM

## Project Description

PowerLLM is a Python project that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to generate, test, and save Python functions. The project aims to provide a seamless experience for developers to create and refine Python functions using advanced AI models.

## Features

- Generate Python functions based on user prompts
- Test generated functions for correctness
- Save generated functions to files
- Handle errors and provide detailed error messages
- Allow users to specify custom coding standards

## Usage Instructions

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Running the Project**: Execute the main script to start the development process:
   ```bash
   python Sample_Coder.py
   ```

3. **Generating Functions**: Follow the prompts to generate and test Python functions. You can choose between single run, multiple runs, or continuous mode.

4. **Saving Functions**: After generating a function, you can save it to a file for future use.

## Examples

### Example 1: Generating a Simple Function

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python Sample_Coder.py
   ```

2. Enter the initial prompt for the function you want to generate:
   ```
   Enter the initial prompt for the development process: Create a function that adds two numbers
   ```

3. Choose the run mode and follow the instructions to generate and test the function.

### Example 2: Handling Errors

If the generated function fails the test, the project will provide detailed error messages and allow you to refine the function based on the feedback.
